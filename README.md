# Objectives
1. The aim of this course is to provide an overview of Computational Science and modelling techniques available to the Computational Scientist
2. The student will be able to describe and apply the basic concepts of modelling and simulation (Validation, Verification, Experimental Frame, etc.)
3. The student will be able to design and analyse ODEs as an approach to understand and model real world systems (particularly epidemics)
4. The student will be able to apply methods of network science to model real world phenomena.
5. The student will be able to compare modelling approaches and understand under which conditions each approach is most appropriate.
6. The student will build a basic understanding of epidemics and be able to understand the factors in epidemics that make them challenging to model.
7. The student will be able to implement and analyse computer simulations using Python (and associated libraries)

# Contents
An introduction to Modelling and Simulation methods (including Ordinary Differential Equations, Networks, Agent-based Models) applied to the topic of epidemics. The students will have an overview of different modelling techniques that come back later in the programme. They are also introduced to the basic Modelling & Simulation concepts.
